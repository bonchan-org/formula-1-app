Drivers do races at different tracks. Each track has the following characteristics:
 
* Name
* Location
* Race distance
* Average speed
* Manager with most wins
* Fastest finish time
 
 
Create a structure that will represent a track. 
 
There should also be an option for easy creation, modification deletion of tracks.

The excercise is structured in that way that you have to complete it by going through multiple steps.

In each step, there will be an issue created for you. Follow the instructions
and do the tasks that are given in the issue. Once, you've completed the tasks,
commited the code and pushed the changes, please close the issue. That way you
will unlock your next issue and be able to progress to the next step until the
very end!

At the beginning, to practice, the first issue doesn't require anything from you to do, but just to practice the flow. Please close the issue and then the real work can begin.

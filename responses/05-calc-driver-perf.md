Every driver that participates at race has a race time. The race time depends on driver's skills, on track's characteristics and on the actual conditions during the race.
 
For each driver that participated in a race calculate their race time using the following guidelines:
 
 
* base time = 1 / Overall * (race distance / avg speed)
* add random number between 1 and 10 to the base time
* if it's driver's favourite track then the race time will be lower for 25
* if it's raining add 20 if driver's talent is below 25, 5 if above 80, else 10
